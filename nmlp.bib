    abstract = "We present a hierarchy of natural language understanding abilities and argue for the importance of moving beyond assessments of understanding at the lexical and sentence levels to the discourse level. We propose the task of anaphora accessibility as a diagnostic for assessing discourse understanding, and to this end, present an evaluation dataset inspired by theoretical research in dynamic semantics. We evaluate human and LLM performance on our dataset and find that LLMs and humans align on some tasks and diverge on others. Such divergence can be explained by LLMs' reliance on specific lexical items during language comprehension, in contrast to human sensitivity to structural abstractions."

In this paper, we cast bridging anaphora resolution as question answering based on context. This allows us to find the antecedent for a given anaphor without knowing any gold mention information (except the anaphor itself). We present a question answering framework (BARQA) for this task, which leverages the power of transfer learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to generate a large amount of ``quasi-bridging'' training data. We show that our model pre-trained on this dataset and fine-tuned on a small amount of in-domain dataset achieves new state-of-the-art results for bridging anaphora resolution on two bridging corpora (ISNotes (Markert et al., 2012) and BASHI (Ro {\ensuremath{\ddot{}}}siger, 2018))."

While prior research has focused on basic-level categories, this study is the first attempt to examine the organization of categories by analyzing exemplars produced at the subordinate level. We present a new Italian psycholinguistic dataset of human-generated exemplars for 187 concrete words. We then leverage these data to evaluate whether textual and vision LLMs produce meaningful exemplars that align with human category organization across three key tasks: exemplar generation, category induction, and typicality judgment. Our findings show a low alignment between humans and LLMs, consistent with previous studies. However, their performance varies notably across different semantic domains. Ultimately, this study highlights both the promises and the constraints of using AI-generated exemplars to support psychological and linguistic research."

This paper investigates the role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting in a 13.1{\%} BLEU improvement in translation."

    abstract = "Large language models (LLMs) serve as the foundation of numerous AI applications today. However, despite their remarkable proficiency in generating coherent text, questions linger regarding their ability in performing fine-grained linguistic annotation tasks, such as detecting nouns or verbs, or identifying more complex syntactic structures like clauses or T-units in input texts. These tasks require precise syntactic and semantic understanding of input text, and when LLMs underperform on specific linguistic structures, it raises concerns about their reliability for detailed linguistic analysis and whether their (even correct) outputs truly reflect an understanding of the inputs. In this paper, we empirically study recent LLMs performance across fine-grained linguistic annotation tasks. Through a series of experiments, we find that recent LLMs show limited efficacy in addressing linguistic queries and often struggle with linguistically complex inputs. We show that the most capable LLM (Llama3-70b) makes notable errors in detecting linguistic structures, such as misidentifying embedded clauses, failing to recognize verb phrases, and confusing complex nominals with clauses. Our study provides valuable insights to inform future endeavors in LLM design and development."

    abstract = "In addition to asking questions about facts in the world, some internet users{---}in particular, second language learners{---}ask questions about language itself. Depending on their proficiency level and audience, they may pose these questions in an L1 (first language) or an L2 (second language). We investigate how multilingual LLMs perform at crosslingual metalinguistic question answering. Focusing on binary questions about sentence grammaticality constructed from error-annotated learner corpora, we prompt three LLMs (Aya, Llama, and GPT) in multiple languages, including English, German, Korean, Russian, and Ukrainian. Our study reveals that the language of the prompt can significantly affect model performance, and despite English being the dominant training language for all three models, prompting in a different language with questions about English often yields better results."
